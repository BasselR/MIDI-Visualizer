# MIDI-Visualizer

*** IN PROGRESS ***

This Python program uses PyGame to create an animation that represents some MIDI input based on musical parameters.

A third party program is used to parse a given MIDI file into a readable JSON object.

Then, the program takes advantage of Python's native library support for JSON to generate Python-style lists and dictionairies from JSON objects.

From there, we use PyGame to create animations based on the now-readable musical parameters.
